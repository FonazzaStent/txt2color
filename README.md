Text to Color version 1.1.0

The program will convert text to a color.
Have fun converting your name, your pet's name, your city's name, your favorite team's name, your favorite song title, to a high design art color.
Paste or write a word or a longer text into the text window. Click on "Generate Color" to convert the text to a color. The resulting color will be displayed in the color frame on the right side. The corresponding Red, Green, Blue and HEX values will appear in the fields below the color frame. You can copy each value pressing the "Copy" button on the right side of the field for use inside a graphic or photo manipulation program. The "Clear" button will clear the text window. Click on "Quit" to close the program.
Best results are achieved with single words or short sentences. Longer texts will usually result in variations of a dark blue shade.
The Windows executable works by double clicking on the file, needing no additional software installed.
If you want to run the Python source you must install Python. Download Python at www.python.org
