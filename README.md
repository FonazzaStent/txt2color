# txt2color
Turn words into colors
The program will convert a short text (up to 50 characters) to a color.
The script requires Python installed on your system. Download latest version at www.python.org.
If you don't want to install Python, you can run the Windows executable file included in the package.
When you start the program, you will be prompted for a text. Input a word or a short sentence and press Enter. This will open a small window where your color is displayed. The same window contains the RGB values and HEX code you can copy (CTRL+C) to use the color in a graphic program or on the web. The program only understands lowercase and capital letters. Special characters such as accented letters, numbers and all other non-letter characters will be ignored. Texts longer than 50 characters will be chopped at 50 characters. Have fun turning your name, your city name, your pet's name, your favorite team's name into a color.
